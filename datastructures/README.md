Data Structures
---------------

Implement an in-memory native language datastructure that operates like a traditional datastore with the following components:

# A primary key/unique identifier
# At least 5 attribute rows
# CRUD operations on records

No disk persistence is allowed/required. You don't have to ensure that data persists between invocations of your program, just a given instance of the running code (vm lifetime..whatever)
